          <p class="lead">
          <ul class="list-unstyled lead">
          <li>(a) Stimulate the attainment of ideals and ambitions of its members;</li>

          <li>(c) Cooperate with the schools where its chapters may be located in fostering these ideals;</li>
          <li>(d) Occupy a progressive, helpful and constructive place in the civic and political life, domestically, and internationally;</li>
          <li>(e) Prepare its members for greater usefulness in causes of humanity, freedom, and dignity of the individual; and,</li>

          At its core, my campaign is about executing our fraternity purpose, fulfilling the responsibilities of the office of Keeper of Records and Seal while preserving the traditions and protocols that have  been defined by our district since its inception in 1935 when M.R. Austell was appointed the first seventh district representative.
          </em>
          </p>
          <h2><strong>I. Service and Duty to Our Chapters</strong></h2>
          <h4><strong>Substantially strengthen our reporting and operational procedures to confront critical issues impacting our district</strong></h4>
          <p class="lead">
          <br>
          <em>
          “We must put service before self and put aside all petty differences and undertake to meet the needs of our district and fraternity according to the demands of the times.”
          </em>
          <br>
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
          These words expressed serve as a major component of my vision for the Office of 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal. Without reservation, I firmly believe that the 7th District need to address the demands of the times as it relates to timely, accurate and relevant information. It is important to examine the current status of what and how the International Office reflects our data in regards to our membership within the 7th District. To ensure that all required training developed and implemented by the Fraternity is conducted within the 7th District. 
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            As the 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal, there are four ACTION items I would immediately employ:
          </p>
          <ol class="lead">
            <li>Work with both the International Executive Director and the Grand KRS to reconcile the current 7th District membership database to ensure efficient accuracy and accountability.</li>
            <li>Identify and address critical need areas that affect the chapters within the 7th District.</li>
            <li>Verify and update as instructed per the District Representative all 7th District correspondence effective immediately, and to formerly disseminate said correspondence in accordance with the 7th District Constitution and Bylaws.</li>
            <li>Implement a quarterly Webinar designed to address growing concerns related to the International Office system updates, chapter protocol and reporting procedures.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2><strong>II. Protect Our Seal and Preserve Our Traditions and Protocols</strong></h2>
          <h4><strong>Protect the 7th District and the traditions and protocols that are unique to us</strong></h4>
          <p class="lead">
          <br>
            We live in a culture which increasingly questions the need for fraternities, and the resulting discussions about the future of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. Omega must continue to focus on the intellectual characteristics and leadership skills that define Omega men.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Action Plan</strong></h3>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>Revisit and provide training on Omega traditions and protocols that are intrinsic to Omegas</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Being Omega Sharp!</li>
              <li>Communicating who we are internally and externally in order to protect the Omega brand.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Preserve the right information for the correct length of time.</li>
            <li>Control and manage records management storage and destruction fees.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate proven practices of good faith through consistent implementation.</li>
            <li>Archive vital information for business continuity and disaster recovery.</li>
            <li>Provide information in a timely and efficient manner regardless of urgency of request.</li>
            <li>Use technology to manage and improve reporting processes.</li>
